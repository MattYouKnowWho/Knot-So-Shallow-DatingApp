# Knot-So-Shallow-DatingApp

## Description

A Dating Application developed for people who are "Not Shallow". 
It was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and RESTful API.

##How It Works

A User will create and account with a Username and password or login with their previously made credentials. 
If the User makes a new account, they will need to fill our their profile and profile picture. 
Once Users are in the dashboard, they will randomly match with one other user. 
If the user does not like their match, they can unmatch if desired. 
Users may also chat with their matched user.
